    <h2>Quinoa Salad Benefit</h2>
    <p>Some people with gluten intolerance, including those with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, need to avoid foods containing gluten.</p>
    <p>People following a gluten-free diet need to choose gluten-free alternatives to gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.</p>    
    <p>Quinoa is naturally gluten-free and makes a nutritious choice for people who want to or need to cut gluten from their diet.</p>        
    <p>Unlike gluten-free products made with refined ingredients, quinoa is a good source of nutrients that gluten-free diets often lack, like:
        
    <ul>
        <li>fiber</li>
        <li>folate</li>
        <li>zinc</li>
        <li>magnesium</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
